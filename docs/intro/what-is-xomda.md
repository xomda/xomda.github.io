# What is XOMDA?

XOMDA stands for E**x**tensible **O**bject **M**odel **D**ata **A**bstraction.
It's a way of defining your data models, and generate code out of them.

It allows to define a centralised object model, out of which code can be generated. This can go from beans, to
database definitions, documentation, dialogs, ...

It's just all in your own hands.
